Language used -Python

Things implemented in the program.
->ID3 algorithm is implemented while creating decision tree.
->The file ID3_algorithm is taking two inputs file- .data and .names file.->Discretization is done on continuous dataset.
->The dataset used are Iris and house-votes-84 from UCI repository.
->The dataset is splitted into test and train data of 20% and 80% respectively.
->The k-fold cross validation is implemented.

Step to run the ID3_algorithm python file
1.The iris.data and iris.names file should be present in the folder.
2.The house-votes-84.data and house-votes-84.names also should be present in the folder.
3.Command to run the python file for iris dataset - 
python ID3_algorithm.py iris.data iris.names
4.Command to run the python file for house of votes - 
python ID3_algorithm.py house-votes-84.data house-votes-84.names
